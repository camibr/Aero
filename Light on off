'''
The idea is to choose one among the following types of light : 
a - Beacon light
b - Strobe light
c - Navigation light
d - Taxi light
e - Landing light

"b", "c", "d", "e" lights are continuous. We might choose to turn them on/off manually and we are asked if we wanna shift to another light
"a" light switches on/off automatically every second, during N seconds
